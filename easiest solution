#In this challenge, the user enters a string and a substring. You have to print the number of times that the substring occurs in the given string. String traversal will take place from left to right, not from right to left.

#NOTE: String letters are case-sensitive.

#Input Format

#The first line of input contains the original string. The next line contains the substring.

#Constraints

 
#Each character in the string is an ascii character.

#Output Format

#Output the integer number indicating the total number of occurrences of the substring in the original string.

#Sample Input

#ABCDCDC
#CDC
#Sample Output

#2


def count_substring(string, sub_string):
    count=0                                                    #set count of 
    for i in range(len(string)-2):                             #using loop to iterate  through string
        if(string[i:i+len(sub_string)]==sub_string):           #using string slices as we have to match it to sub_string so length should be equal to len of sub_string
            count=count+1                                      #increasing count whenever match is found
        
    return count                                               #returning the count
